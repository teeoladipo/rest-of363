#+TITLE: Example paper
#+AUTHOR: Tee Oladipo 

* Introduction 

This is an example of a report being written in org 

* Methods

My computer, emacs and the terminal within Ubuntu

* Results

This is a placeholder for where the results would go. 

#+begin_src R
doomsday <- function(a, b)
 {  doom <- (a/b)  
return (doom)}
result <- eval(doomsday(4, 2))
print(result)
#+end_src 

#+begin_src Python
import pandas as pd
dpd = pd.read_csv("./SCS/data.csv")
column_names = dpd.columns.values
print("Column Names:", column_names)
#+END_SRC

Here is a figure that shows the results from the last assignment: 

//py-inter-plt.png//
# I had to use one of Olive's plots because I'm unable to do anything on my computer related to emacs now. 

As seen in Figure 1, the results indicate that something is definitely happening.
 
* Conclusions

Therefore, I hope I've proved my competence with compiling reports in Emacs
