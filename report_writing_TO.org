* Introduction 

This is an example of a report being written in org 

* Methods

My computer, emacs and the terminal within Ubuntu

* Results

This is a placeholder for where the results would go. 

#+begin_src R
doomsday <- function(a, b)
 {  doom <- (a/b)  
return (doom)}
result <- eval(doomsday(4, 2))
print(result)
#+end_src 

#+begin_src Python
import pandas as pd
dpd = pd.read_csv("./SCS/data.csv")
column_names = dpd.columns.values
print("Column Names:", column_names)
#+END_SRC

Here is a figure that shows the results from the last assignment: 
[[//figure.png]] #gotta insert something here

As seen in Figure 1, the results indicate that something is definitely happening.
 
* Conclusions

Therefore, I hope I've proved my competence with compiling reports in Emacs
